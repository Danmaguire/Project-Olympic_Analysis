    "# How? \n",
    "I think the easiest way to do this would to just get an ordered list of all the NOCs who won a medal (podiumed) for each games. If the list is order as the df above we know each set of three have the podium relationsip. Then after we get these lists, one for each games we can then turn the list form e.g. ['GER', 'USA' 'CHN'....] to ['GER,CHN', 'GER,USA', 'USA,CHN'....] so we need up with lists of relationships for each olympics. \n",
    "This is crucial because as of now one easy way to create a network of relationships is to have a csv containg nodes (Unique NOC names) and relationships (the lists we talked about above). \n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "The other consideration we have to deal with is the sitatuions of draws and less than three medals awarded like we talked about above. This would mean that a list of all the NOCs sorted like this ['GER', 'USA' 'CHN'....] taking every three to be a podium  might not represent the relatioships correctly because as we said before we could have a draw sitatuion where four NOCs could be on a podium. <br> </br>\n",
    "This issue is addressed below by putting each events podiums into a seperate list and putting all these event lists into a list that represent that given olympic games. Then we will put all of these lists of games into a final list. \n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "So to be clear we will have a main list of olympic games lists and in each olympic games list there will be lists for every event in that games containing every NOC that reaches the podium for that event. "
